This is a shortlist of resources and personal learnings that I always go back to for revising and reminding myself, while PM'ng 


### Framework for new 0-1 Products

- [Business Canvas Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas)
  - Digest this model, think and iterate through all the components as you progress in the journey.  
  - Compare build side with sell side key factors. Check if things are in balance through out the course of the product development lifecycle. 
- Focus on defining, iterating on Business objectives first, before jumping to a product roadmap. 
- Focus on Qualitative metrics. Don't force yourself to apply Quantitative metrics, trying to follow OKR principles  
- The role of product management extends to everyone in this phase. The lines blur between Engineers, Product and Business(customer facing) team members when it comes to defining what needs to be built, understanding the customer, market etc. So, be flexible in taking inputs from everyone. 
- The popular nuances and rules of product management won't work in this phase of a product/business. This is almost like a new startup, with too many uncertainities. 
- Respect your Gut feeling in this phase, contrary to what is adviced in PM 

### Product Management

- Measuring what matters , by the legend , John Doer 
  - The all time great, OKR framework. Great Case Studies. 
  - Objective defines what. KR defines how. 
  - Less is more. List should indicate focus and what is more important. 
  - Half top down, half bottom up (Let the top management put up their okrs and ask teams to come up with theirs and then merge to decide the final list)
  - In operational urgency quarters, this can be more top down directed
  - Quantity kr and quality kr both should accompany an objective. 

- Good vs Bad PM - Ben Horowitz 
- Product Roadmaps relaunched : The process behind creating good product roadmaps

### Leadership and team management principles 

- Trillion Dollar Coach on Bill Campbell 
  - Coach/Guru behind the leaders of Google, Facebook, Apple etc. 
  - Feels like practicing being a good human automatically makes you a good leader. - This book is a great reminder for all simple, but very effective practices around communication, confrontation, managing conflicts, inspiring people, managing teams, respecting and wearing your own identity daily to the workplace etc. 
- Hard Things about Hard Things, by Ben Horowitz 
  - Great war stories to keep reminding yourself if you are running/working in a startup 
  -  Also has useful resources for day to day work life like template to a good 1:1 meeting, Good PM vs Bad PM traits, basic principles of an M&A process/how to sell. 

### Strong Product Understanding 

- Have a strong grip of market and industry -> this is how you build the spidey sense of a great PM 
- Technical Architecture on your fingertips - this seems like an overkill to a PM,  but this I regard highly and worship. Because, it helps me in having effective conversations with the engineers. Understand the build problem, specially if 0-1 lifecycle. 
- Have a clear reading of all important stakeholders  - Exec sponsors, Key engineering leaders, On-ground sales/BD people. 
- Understand your product space extremely thorough- at the back of your hand. Competition, market trends etc.
