Built and launched AI & deep-tech products. 
12+ years in Seed to Series C startup lifecycle.

I am a product leader and entrepreneur currently solving the unstructured data problem of the mobility industry. 

As the Senior Director of Product at Ridecell, I lead the AI and Data strategy for the company, building new product lines and engagements with Enterprise fleets, automotive OEMs, Tier1s, and insurance companies.

I also mentor startups and advice VC firms on my leisure time, in the fields of 
robotics and AI. 

Previously, I co-founded Auro Robotics, a YCombinator-backed startup (YC S15) that built low-speed autonomous shuttles for last-mile transportation. I led the product development across three autonomous vehicle versions, and launched one of the first commercial autonomous shuttle services in the US in 2016. 
I also received a research grant from the President of India and was named in the Forbes Asia 30 Under 30 list in 2017. 
My technical background lies in robotics, AI and data. I drove/engaged multi-million dollar enterprise deals in automotive, insurance and mobility industries.

Other Interests: 
I'm a huge history buff. I'm also into poetry- wrote over 50 songs in Telugu and Hindi covering Love, Nature and Philosophy.
