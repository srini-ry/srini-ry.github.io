## Jensen's Keynote

A stadium full of AI enthusiasts while Jensen delivers his smoothest, best keynote speech. The Euphoria was out of the world, something one could witness only in the Silicon Valley. 

### Highlights 
- **This is a brand New Industry - Generative AI Industry worth $100 Trillion** , where AI factories (GPU data centers) will be creating specialized Intelligences for different industries/use cases 
- **Blackwell** - 30X faster inference than current SOTA Hopper. 
- Nvidia's entry into  **Enterprise IT services**: We are effectively an AI foundry with 3 pillars **NIMS, NEMO ecosystem, DGX cloud**. Partnered with SAP, Servicenow and Snowflake. 
- **Project Groot** - General purpose foundation model for humanoid, trained on physically correct Omniverse Simulation. 


### Introduction and Partners 

- **This is a Brand New Industry - Generative AI Industry worth $100 Trillion** , where AI factories (GPU data centers) will be creating specialized Intelligences for different industries/use cases 
- Accelerated computing is more important than general computing
- For simulation, it's more about acceleration, not about reducing cost. We want to do digital twins - completely simulated 
- Accelerated computing - infra is CUDA GPUs 
- **3 partners to accelerate systems and chips** 
    - **Ansys** - important partner for sim - with Omniverse  - giant install base 
    - **Synopsis** - CUDA is going to accelerate synopsis software - accelerate chip computational  lithography. Next step would be to apply GenAI to 
    - **Cadence** - Copilots for EDA , chip design
- Latest Openai model is 1.8 trillion params - 30-40 billion quadrillion flops needed - 30 billion secs (1000 yrs) needed if you have 1 peta flop. 
   - **What we need are bigger gpus** - whole bunch of gpus together. With melanox we built Selene, eos.

### New Chips 

- Introducing **Blackwell** 
   - 2nd Gen transformer engine
   - ras engine - 100% in system self test 
   - secure AI - encryption and tee
   - decompression engine - 800 gb/sec
   - AI super chip 
   - 5th Gen nvlink 
   - 2.5 times fpa performance for training. New fp6. New fp4. 
   - 5x inference token generation capability as hopper
- Last 8yrs - we increased AI compute by 1000x. For comparison,  compute increased 10x every 5 yrs in the past, following Moores law. Now, it's 100x every 10 yrs. 
- Nvlink switch chip - 200gbps serdes. 
- New DGX chip - 130tbps - entire internet bandwidth of today - 5000 nvlink cables over 2 miles. 
- Training comparion - 
  - For a GPT MOE 1.8 Trillion parameter model 
  - Blackwell needs only 2000 GPUs consuming only 4MW power i.e. 1/4th power to train GPT MOE 1.8T in 90 days. Blackwell gb200 nvl72. Hopper was 8000 GPUs for same 90 days. 
  - Blackwell is 30x faster than Hopper for inference. Nvlink is communicating 10x faster. 
- **future data centers are going to be thought as AI factories - Generating intelligence. Generation of intelligence**

### Science products 

- Core diff - generative AI for weather prediction. Current ones are 25 km res. Now to 2km res. 1000 times speed and 3 times energy efficient. The weather company partnership. 
- BioNemo - for powerful drug discovery 

### Enterprise AI  

- NIMS - Nvidia inference microservice 
    - 100s of millions of cuda GPUs install base
    - Chatbots inside nims 
    - e g. chip designer chatbot . 
    - Nemo microservice 
    - **We are effectively an AI foundry - 3 pillars nims, nemo microservice, dgx cloud** 
- Team of AI - super AI's - NIMS
- internal chatbot use cases
   - chat with bugs database  - with Nemo retriever 
   - chat for chip designer.  
- Diana - digital human nim 
- **so many companies - enterprise it industries are sitting on a goldmine - ton of data - if u can convert them to copilots** 
- hence, we are working with IT leaders -  sap , service now , cohesity , snowflake, NetApp. - working with nims, Nvidia Nemo. 

### Robotics 

- Physical AI - 3 computers - dgx, ovx, AGX 

- **Chatgpt moment for robotics is around the corner**. AGX - SoC - high speed process for ai .
- what is RL feedback of a robot? - by physical feedback - hence we need Omniverse. Physically accurate sim. 
- Omniverse cloud APIs . Chatusd - Chatbot that understands usd. 
- Siemens partnership - heavy industries. Siemens is building industrial metaverse. 
- Nissan - integrated omniverse - for design, manufacturing , development - common ground truth. 
- Omniverse cloud now can stream to apple vision pro. 
- Everything that moves will become robotic. 
- byd now, Mercedes, jlr - soon. Adopting transformer - Thor AGX system. 
- building the entire stack 
- functional asil d systems 
- 1.3M robotics developers - Isaac. 
- Isaac preceptor - incredible soa vision odometry, 3d reconstruction, depth modalities. Isaac manipulator- 6d pose for actuators. 
- a lot of imitation training data. Isaac rl gym. Thor designed for transformer engines
- **project Groot** - general purpose foundation model for humanoid. Isaac cloud - Omniverse, Isaac sim. Trained on osmo. Train Groot in physically correct simulation. 
- Omniverse - Operating System of robotics
