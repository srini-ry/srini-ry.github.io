Yes, they are hard and it will cause you deep pain when they fail. And fail — 9 out of 10 will. You are playing against the odds. It’s like jumping off the cliff, and trying to build a plane before you land. Yet the pain and struggle you endeavor throughout the course are worth it and serve as a self-realization act. In the end, whether the startup succeeds or fails, you walk into the sunset gaining an unbeatable world view of corporations, people, and life in general.</p> <p>A Startup is like jumping off the cliff and trying to build a plane before you land. But you won’t die in case you crash. You’ll get up and walk into the sunset with a better worldview.</p> <p>Off late, a lot of my friends are planning to start a new venture. Their reasons vary — some want to solve an inherent problem they discovered in their current industry, some want to scale up the niche creative work they already do for a living, while some are just bored /stuck in their jobs and want a way out. It might be the pandemic WFH driving this phenomenon as well — the additional time in everyone’s plate catalyzing a self-awareness mental trip of “what is the purpose of my life”? — which by the way is a great startup inducer.</p> <p>So I’m writing this blog for my friends and beyond, to cover the why of startup.</p> <p>Disclaimer — I’m not a highly successful entrepreneur by any measure, but I’ve been in the field of startups for the last 9 years now, having been a part of 3 new product journeys from scratch, two startups, and one exit (profile here). You can consider me as a budding entrepreneur who’s here for lifelong learning.</p> <h3 id="the-why-before-the-how">The Why Before the How</h3> <p>The question ‘Why’ is a frame of mind and a way of living when it comes to entrepreneurship. So, I’ll start with that Why for this series as well. The details of how can follow, but why should anyone even do a startup first thing in place ? And why do I think, everyone should try it at least once in their life?</p> <p>A typical startup journey is akin to a condensed, roller coaster version of one’s full professional life. You’ll get yourself exposed to all the facets of running a company. You’ll start with an idea, build the prototype, hire your core team members, raise money from investors, identify and sell to your customers and grow your product and business. In a way, a Startup is like a crash course version of one’s professional career. You’ll go through the full cycle in a short period of time.</p> <p>But one could gain all these experiences from a well-designed product management program in a big tech company as well. So, why go through all the hardships, stomach punches, and ramen noodle lunches?</p> <p>I wish I could give you one single reason, but human nature is so complex, that attributing the reasons for starting a new journey to one or two, would be unfair and naive. If you look at Founders who have done this in the past — the reasons come in all shapes and sizes- for purpose-oriented founders, it boils down to a strong purpose of existence, action-oriented founders do one job really well and add scale to it turn it into a startup creating more value, and sometimes it comes down to the basic human traits of greed or fear of missing out. Sindbad the sailor is one very good example of why an entrepreneur goes back to the sea of dangers every single time. Your reason could be any of the above — but a common theme among all the successful entrepreneurs is that they like their struggle. They like their hustle. If you are someone who’s agitated too often with a career or life that has turned too comfortable or complacent, maybe you should startup. If you are someone who’s more ambitious than what a 9 to 5 career can give you, maybe you should startup. If you are a dreamer, you should definitely startup. If you don’t like the establishment, you better break it with a new entity, thought, way of working — i.e. a startup. This holds true for any individual — be it a corporate professional, a student, a government servant, a homemaker, or a retired senior.</p> <p>Everyone should try a startup. This is a gutsy and maybe even a stupid statement to make as per many people. The popular opinion is that startups are hard — they’re not like hiking a mountain in your backyard, they’re like hiking Mt Whitney — you’ve got to come prepared or you may fall and die. Which, in a way is true. But, you won’t actually die, you’d be hit with this terrible, stomach-churning feeling of a bad breakup when your startup fails. And you grow when you live past that failure. The pain and failure are totally worth it, and I’m not being romantic here, just being utterly practical. The experience is sure overwhelming, but when done properly it develops within you a mature world view, a strong perspective of corporations, scale, growth, people profiles, and the two fundamental elements it all comes down to — building and selling.</p> <h3 id="but-what-about-the-2-rule">But what about the 2% rule?</h3> <p>Michael Seibel (YC CEO and partner) says this about the three sets of people — 1% people are truly entrepreneurial and flourish under pressure and uncertainty, compared to being a part of a large organization. Another small percent (say another 1%) are impactful and resourceful in any setting — be it an uncertain startup or a structured establishment. The rest of the 98% are people who need a system to optimize, a working structure which they can improve and grow and it wouldn’t be a good idea for this 98% to do a startup. What he said is true. But I still stand by what I just said — everyone should try doing a startup. You’ll never know if you can succeed and if you’re in the 2% that Seibel said until you try it. You can’t come to a preconceived notion that you belong to the 98% who are better working for established organizations. People say you should ask yourself this deep dive question if you can thrive under uncertainty and ambiguity, to know if you are good for startups. But in my opinion, you wouldn’t know the answer for sure until you are in that situation. A strong motive, inspiration, and drive of succeeding and seeing the change you dreamt of often makes you do things you weren’t previously capable of. You’ll never know until you try. So, don’t sit out and say you’re better off as an audience and not good at playing. Moreover, there are methods and ways to decide when one should close their startup if the hypothesis is failing (yes, that’s an option contrary to the popular opinion of Never Give up) and get back to their normal life. There is always a restart next to the gameover button, after losing the three lives.</p> <p>There is a national and geographical angle to this as well — if I consider specially the case of India, on why it needs startups more than any other populist government welfare schemes today, but may be I’ll address that in a separate blog post.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Tracking-Safety-in-the-world-of-AI/">Tracking Safety - from AVs to the world of LLMs</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Srinivas Reddy Aellala.
